    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "With the recent publicity regarding police shootings in the United States, two of the questions that have arose from this are 1) Are police in the United States more prone to acts of excessive violence more so than any other developed country and 2) Are African-Americans disproportionately more likely to be targeted and shot at than any other race (respective to their population size)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Barring all external factors, we should expect to see officers in uniform treat people of all demographics with the same respect and response, and for all ethnicities to behave more or less the same way, with respect to the law. All of these incidents regarding blue on black violence projects the image that police are unfairly targeting African Americans and quick to turn to excessive force.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "One component of addressing this issue will be done by examining the demographics behind all reported fatal incidents between February 2015 to July 2017. Our hypothesis is that police unfairly bestow judgment and execution on certain demographics, mostly African-Americans, and we will not not see an equal distribution on killings relative to the proportion of each demographic in the US. The null hypothesis will be that race has no impact on police killing rates, and fatality rates by ethnicities  will be roughly in line with the average fatality rates."

The dataset used for this proposal requires minimal data cleanup, but all incomplete entries have been removed.
